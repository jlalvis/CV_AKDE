# CV_AKDE
### Cross-validation approach for adaptive kernel density estimation in structural uncertainty quantification.
Files `discrete_structural.ipynb` and `continuous_structural.ipynb` show how to compute each of the different features and a two-dimensional visualization in which color displays the value of the structural parameter.

Files `CV_discrete.ipynb` and `CV_continuous.ipynb` show how to build the cross-validation matrix.
